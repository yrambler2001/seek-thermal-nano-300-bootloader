/* keys.c — CompactPro_43X0_Bootloader (reconstructed)
 *
 * Embedded key material, the boot-config base pointer, and the build-info block.
 *
 * This image carries TWO keys plus a dual-purpose mask block:
 *   - g_key_mask : 16 bytes that serve BOTH as Key A (the transport/OTA key,
 *                  seeded directly into the xorshift state) AND as the whitening
 *                  mask XORed into the silicon device-ID when Key B is derived
 *                  from hardware.
 *   - g_keyB     : the fixed embedded Key B (the at-rest device key), used when
 *                  the build marker selects the fixed-key path (it does here).
 * The config pointer and both keys live in the tail of .data (flash LMA, copied
 * to RAM by CRT0). The first ~0x13C bytes of .data belong to the imported
 * driver's mutable tables and are part of the driver blob, not this file.
 *
 * NOTE: these are recovered constants, not secrets — embedded in clear in the
 * flash image. A 128-bit-keyed xorshift128 plus a 32-bit additive checksum is
 * obfuscation, not authenticated encryption.
 *
 * Build identity: marker {01,02,00,00} (composite 0x01020000), built
 * "Jun 26 2016" "11:08:15". The only thing that differs from the FF sibling
 * build (built 31 s later, "11:08:46") is the two keys, this time string, and
 * the +0x1C0 flash addresses.
